# The Third Iteration of Szpiewnik Szybkiego Szukania

The "Quick Querying Qongbook" is an reimagining of my previous app **Projekt Organista**, which is designed to help the organist manage songs and psalms played during service. The changes I've done include:

- more framework-oriented system
- proper implementation of React

- building song sets
- displaying said song sets
- managing songs and ordinarium
- responsiveness
- personalisation of mass formulas

This app is available at http://sz3.wpww.pl/
