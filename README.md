# SzSzSz3, the third iteration of Szpiewnik Szybkiego Szukania

This is the reimagination of my previous app **Projekt Organista**, which is designed to help the organist manage songs and psalms played.

This time, my goal is to completely abandon PHP and focus on 100% React-based system, which features include:

- building song sets
- displaying said song sets
- managing songs and ordinarium
- responsiveness
- availability offline
